Useful Coordinate Transforms
set_tool_reference(coords) where coords = [x y z rx ry rz]
set_world_reference(coords)
set_reference_frame(coords)

Plan for code development with force sensors:
Begin by adding tool coordinate frame of the ultrasound probe (Doesn't work too well)
Next, release the servos and bring the probe point to the phantom, then get coordinates at corner (Good idea, may need 3 points)
If helpful, get coordinates for the other corner(s) of phantom (will need to)
Potentially get coordinates at highest point of the phantom (not necessary as of right now)
Use phantom coordinates to create a 3D box that the phantom must be inside (not necessary as of right now)
Use force sensor data to either reduce the size of the 3D box (needless computation)
Or just set a linear path and use the force sensor data to change the z coordinates (will probably do)

Develop a python function to keep the probe normal to the phantom's surface (in progress)
Use multiple force sensors around ultrasound probe end, rotate probe until all sensors give the same force? (in progress)
